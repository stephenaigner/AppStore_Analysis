# App Store Analysis

### Description:
SQL guided project from "Lore So What Youtube channel", analyzing Apple store data sourced from [Here.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ramamet4/app-store-apple-data-set-10k-apps?select=AppleStore.csv) The goal of this project was to assist an app developer with finding metrics that cause higher or lower app ratings.

### Analysis:

* The game genre had the highest number of applications with 3862 apps. The second highest genre was Entertainment with 535 apps
* The average rating for all apps was 3.53
* Paid apps had a higher average rating of 3.72 than free apps with an average rating of 3.38
* Apps with 10 - 30 supported languages had the highest average rating of 4.13, then 30+ languages with 3.78, and under 10 with 3.37
* Catalogs, finance, book, navigation, and lifestyle genres had the lowest average ratings of 2.1, 2.43, 2.48, 2.68 and 2.81 respectively
* Productivity, music, photo/video, business, and health/fitness genres had the highest average ratings of 4.01, 3.98, 3.8, 3.75, and 3.7 respectively
* There is a correlation between description length and ratings. Apps with long descriptions had an average rating of 3.86, medium length had 3.23 rating, and short descriptions had a 2.53 rating

### Summary:

Based on these findings, I would recommend the developer to create a paid application in the productivity genre that supports 10 - 30 languages with a long detailed description. I would avoid apps with game and entertainment genres because of the high competition levels as well as genres with low average ratings.
